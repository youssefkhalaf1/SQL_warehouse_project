Welcome! 👋

This project is a Data Warehouse designed to organize and prepare data for analysis.
The main goal of this project is to collect raw data from multiple sources — specifically CRM and ERP systems provided in CSV format — then clean, transform, and structure this data to make it accurate and analysis-ready.

The prepared data can then be used to generate insights and support data-driven decision-making 📊.

How the project is structured

The data warehouse is built using a three-layer architecture:

1️⃣ Bronze Layer
This layer stores the raw data exactly as it comes from the source systems, without any changes or transformations.

2️⃣ Silver Layer
In this layer, the data is cleaned and transformed.
Any errors, inconsistencies, or quality issues are handled to ensure the data is reliable and consistent.

3️⃣ Gold Layer
This is the final layer where the data is organized, aggregated, and structured in a way that makes it ready for reporting, analytics, and business insights ✨.

This project focuses on building a clear and practical data warehouse pipeline that turns raw data into valuable, analysis-ready information.
